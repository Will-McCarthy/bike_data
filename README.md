# bike_data

bike_data is a data science project focused on understanding the mountain bike market.

## Hi Linkedin,



In an effort to demonstrate my data science expertise, I turned my passion into a data science project, a "passion project" if you will.



As many of you know, I have a healthy obsession with mountain biking. Personally, I have four bikes. Although this would be enough for most people, the correct number of bikes is n+1, where n is the current number of bikes owned. I decided to find my next bike by doing some analysis on the mountain bike market.



The first step was to obtain a dataset, so I wrote a web scraper and pulled data on 26k mountain bikes from my favorite place to go shopping: Pinkbike's buy/sell market. This market is similar to craigslist for selling high-end, used mountain bikes.



This is the first step an exciting project! Take a look at my scraper and the results on my github: https://github.com/Will-McCarthy/bike_data/tree/main.



My next steps for this project are to create a database, clean and visualize the data, and finally use ML algorithms to answer more difficult questions.



Stay tuned on my account for more project updates, coming soon!
