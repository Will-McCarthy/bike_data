# bike_data

bike_data is a data science project focused on understanding the mountain bike market.

# Hi Linkedin,

I started this data science project to demonstrate some of my data science skills! 

As many of you know, I have an obsession with mountian biking. Personally, I have 4 bikes. Although that seems like enough, the correct number of bikes is n+1, where n is the current number of bikes owned. I decided to find my next bike by doing some analysis on the mountian bike market. 

My first step was to get a dataset, so I wrote a web scraper. My favorite place to go shopping for mountian bikes is pinkbike's buy/sell market. Its a website similar to craigslist for selling high end used mountian bikes peer to peer. You can see my scraper and the results on my github.
